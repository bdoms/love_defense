## Introduction

This is a simple Tower Defense game. It was created with [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) for use as a rapid prototype to explore gameplay and code structure. It may contain bugs or ineffeciencies, but it should nonetheless prove useful as an example for education purposes.

## Inspiration

A fully-featured, multi-level Xbox 360 Indie Game was eventually created from concepts that appear in this prototype. That game is [Defend Earth or Die!](http://www.zenotter.com/), and you can learn more about it on [its marketplace page](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Defend-Earth-or-Die/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258550dae) or watch [the trailer on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQAFOviBxuE). However note that none of the code or media assets from this prototype appear in the final version of that game.

## Contributions

Pull requests for bug fixes, optimizations, or code cleanup are welcome. New features will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
